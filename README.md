## End-result

Goal is to have all informations on the left side of the shell, and remove anything that can pop up on the right as It causes issue when copy/pasting multi-lines

The theme will be installed on a common directory in **/usr/share** to be useable by all users (new or existing) with common themes

To be added:
- Add installation process

This repo will be closed when I manage to install this with Ansible script, so all new hosts will have the same shell/theme
